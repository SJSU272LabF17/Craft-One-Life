Current Scenario: 

According to recent survey, the annual national count of homeless  people in the U.S. has risen for first time since 2010. 22 percentage of the respondents reported job loss.
There are also cases where people are incredibly lonely and talented but might not get chance to expose their talents. They do not have enough finance to support their writing.


Proposed Scenario:

We have designed this portal for homeless and differently-abled persons to expose their talent to the world through their exceptional talent of creative writings and short stories.
By showcasing and selling artwork, they gain self-confidence and earn money that permeates all aspects of their lives.CraftOneLife’s mission is to empower 
artists living with homelessness or disabilities through the celebration and sale of their artwork.
It's all about creating opportunity, empowerment and validations.
